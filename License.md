## Vattic's Usage Guidelines
It's fine for people to use stuff from the Faithful 32x32 pack so long as guidelines bellow are followed.  

### Things that are fine:  
- Use as placeholders.  
- Using as many textures as you've made yourself.  
- Using the items or paintings.  
- Use as base for mod textures.  

### Requirements:  
- Give clear credit.  
- Link back to the Faithful 32x32 thread.  
- Be honest about what you are using.  
- No money making links.  

### On remix/tweaked packs:  
- Let's Players can share a modified copy with fans.  
- Adventure map makers can provide modified copy to go along with it.  

### If either of the above apply:  
- You must distribute through YouTube video descriptions or your series'/map's forum topic and not create a separate thread for the pack.  
- To avoid people uploading a video just so they can upload a copy of the pack Let's Players must have a decent number of videos that use the pack and a decent number of subscribers.  

### Finally:
- If I decide I don't want you using stuff from the pack then that is final. This will only be the case in unusual circumstances.  
- These guidelines can be changed at any time.

## Faithful's / Classic Faithful's Usage Guidelines
ALL FAITHFUL ASSETS ARE DISTRIBUTING WITH THESE GUIDELINES BELOW:

### Requirements if you are distributing any assets by us:
1. Give clear credit in an appropriate place (e.g. video descriptions, pack.mcmetas, listing descriptions).
2. Link back to our website, which you can find here: https://faithfulpack.net/
3. Be honest about what you are using and use common sense. Basically, don't take credit for stuff you didn't make and give proper attribution to any textures you use or modify.
4. Do not monetise under any circumstances, including use of link shorteners. Any content with assets made by us must be entirely free and open sourced, to uphold our standards. This includes redistribution on the Bedrock Marketplace or locking behind a paywall (e.g. Patreon). Taking voluntary donations or participating in reward programs (e.g. CurseForge points, YouTube monetization) is allowed.
5. Don't make your projects look official when they aren't. Examples of this would be copying our branding, marking a project as "official", etc, in a way that would confuse the average viewer into believing a project is official when it isn't.
6. When possible, give credit to each texture individually, particularly if your project mixes multiple packs. (You can use our gallery at https://webapp.faithfulpack.net/#/gallery/, or the "credits.txt" file present in every Classic Faithful pack to help you find specific authors.) However, if your project is mostly our assets you can just give credit to all of them in one entry.
7. This file, unmodified, must be included in all forms of content that use any assets of us.

### You must abide by the above rules if you are doing any of the following:
1. Distributing our assets in any form, modified or not.
2. Using our textures as placeholders.
3. Using our textures as a base for any of your own textures that you're making public.
4. Using a few textures that you cannot properly make yourself (e.g. paintings).
5. Distributing a modified copy as a content creator with your videos/streams.
6. Using textures for adventure maps, server resource packs, mod textures, or data packs.

### Exceptions
1. If you're doing anything privately and undistributed to our assets (e.g. custom edit for personal use, unpublished add-ons, mod support, using the pack for a small private Minecraft server, or edits either by you or from different packs) you can safely disregard all of these requirements since you are not gaining unfairly from us in any form.

### For Classic Faithful only
1. If your pack can be considered an add-on (a secondary pack meant to be run on top of the main pack), do not claim it as an official one anywhere. Instead, submit it to us, so we can add it to the official add-on database. You can do that in Classic Faithful's server: https://discord.gg/KSEhCVtg4J (You can still post it anywhere you want â€“ just don't brand it as an official Classic Faithful add-on without submitting it to us.)
2. If you are using textures made prior to March 2016 (Minecraft Release 1.9), they are licensed under Vattic's original Faithful 32x32 license, which is different to this license. You can find the original license here, under "Usage Guidelines", if you are interested: https://web.archive.org/web/20150607220656/http://www.minecraftforum.net:80/forums/mapping-and-modding/resource-packs/1223254-faithful-32x32-pack-update-red-cat-clay-1-8

### We reserve the right to
1. Refuse the ability to use, distribute, or modify any assets from us. This action would be final, generally only in the case of unusual circumstances.
2. Take legal action if you do not comply with these guidelines.
3. Change this license at any time for any reason.
